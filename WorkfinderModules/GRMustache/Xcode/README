Moustache

README

This project is now the home of GRMoustache, an open source templating library that was maintained on cocoapods.

The author has seemingly vanished and no longer supports the product or accepts pull requests.

iOS Workfinder is dependent on this library in order to populate the covering letter (which is essentially a Moustache template).

The library was brought in-house because we needed to upgrade it to Swift 4, whereas the last maintained version was stuck on Swift 3
